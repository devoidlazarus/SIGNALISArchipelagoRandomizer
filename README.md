# SIGNALIS Archipelago Randomizer
A randomizer mod for the game [SIGNALIS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/) by rose-engine, to use with the [Archipelago randomizer](https://archipelago.gg/).

Setup instructions for this mod can be found here: [installation_instructions.md](https://github.com/devoidlazarus/SIGNALISArchipelagoRandomizer/blob/main/installation_instructions.md)

Archipelago setup guides can be found here: https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/

## What is the Archipelago Randomizer?
Archipelago is a randomizer system that allows for multiple games to randomize their items *with each other.* For example, your **Pistol** in SIGNALIS may be locked behind a location in your friend's Hollow Knight that requires **Crystal Dash** to get to. On the other hand, your friend's **Crystal Dash** is locked behind your **Plate of Eternity** item in SIGNALIS, meaning you would have to go get the **Plate of Eternity** in order to grant your friend the ability to use **Crystal Dash**.

This SIGNALIS mod also can be randomized entirely within itself. Multiple games are not required to generate a successful randomization seed.

## What is randomized in this mod?
All key items, some weapons, ammo pickups, and health pickups are randomized and adjusted per the difficulty in which the player is playing on.

### Exceptions
Items that are the result of combining two items (i.e. the **Butterfly Key**) are *not* randomized. You can get the item the vanilla way by combining the items needed, assuming you have received those component parts via Archipelago. 
 - The **Revolver** is considered one of these items, since you must combine the **Hunter Key** and the **Weapon Case** in order to receive it in vanilla.
 - The **Rifle** is also considered one of these items, since you must "combine" the **Small Bottle** with Isa in order to receive it in vanilla.
 - The "Earth" Key is also considered one of these items, since you must "combine" the **Blank Key** with the pattern printing machine in order to receive it in vanilla.

## Quality of Life changes
Given the nature of this mod and how it fundamentally breaks the linearity of a game that is considered very much linear, this mod implements a few QoL changes. In order to help the randomizer function as close to a proper randomizer as possible, these changes players to "sequence break" as much as the randomizer allows. Below are the changes made to gameplay:
 - All "meat walls" in Rotfront, which are normally picked up by obtaining certain tarot card items, are completely disabled.
 - Your storage box can be accessed at any time by pressing F11.
 - You can access any previously-entered level via a selection menu by pressing F8.
